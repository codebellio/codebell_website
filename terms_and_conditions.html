                    <h2>9. Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</h2>
                    <p>a) If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really free: we do not ask you
                        for your credit
                        card and — just like for customers who pay for our Services. </p>
                    <p>b) Paying online - Once you have registered and set up an account with us, Premium services may
                        be subscribed to
                        by following the prompts that will appear on-screen. You may check and correct any input errors
                        up until the
                        point at which you submit your purchase to us by clicking the [“Pay now”] button on the checkout
                        page. You
                        acknowledge that by clicking on the [“Pay now”] button, you enter into an obligation to pay for
                        the Premium
                        subscription. The contract between you and us in relation to the Service(s) subscribed to
                        (“Contract”) will be
                        formed at the moment we confirm your purchase of the Premium subscription on the following page.
                    </p>
                    <p>c) Subscriptions - Use of a Premium account requires an up-to-date subscription payment, as set
                        out on the Site.
                        Payment for a subscription is due upfront, is non-refundable and can be made by any of the
                        payment methods
                        available on the Site. Failure to make regular payments on Premium accounts may result in
                        suspension of features
                        associated with Premium accounts.</p>
                    <p>d) The subscription gives you access to a Premium account for a period of a year unless specified
                        otherwise
                        (“Subscription Period”). At the end of this Subscription Period, your subscription will
                        automatically renew (for
                        an equivalent period (and continue to do so), unless you have already cancelled your
                        subscription.</p>
                    <p>e) If your subscription to a Service renews, charges for each renewal period (at the same level
                        as the preceding
                        subscription period, unless the charges have increased, in which case we will notify you at
                        least 14 days
                        beforehand) will automatically be charged to your account, in advance, on the renewal date (or
                        shortly before or
                        after), unless you have already cancelled your subscription.</p>
                    <p>f) If you do not wish your subscription to a Service to renew automatically at the end of the
                        then-current
                        subscription period you must notify us (see “Contacting us”), or alter the subscription renewal
                        settings of your
                        account through the Site, at least 7 days in advance of renewal. If you do not do this or not in
                        sufficient
                        time, you will have authorized us to charge the applicable fees described above and you agree to
                        pay such fees.
                        It is your responsibility to notify us in advance of renewal.</p>
                    <p>g) Missed payments - If we are unable to collect payment – for example because of rejected card
                        transactions or
                        unpaid invoices – the account in question will be made unavailable (“Frozen”) until the required
                        payment is
                        received. </p>
                    <p>h) Free Trial: From time to time, we may offer products or features available at no charge for a
                        trial period, at
                        our sole discretion, including as to duration and scope of no charge offers. However, we reserve
                        the right to
                        charge you for such products (at the normal rate) in the event that we determine (in our
                        reasonable discretion)
                        that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or
                        other device or
                        anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you. </p>
                    <p>i) For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up.
                        After the trial
                        period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will freeze
                        your account and
                        it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we
                        will queue it up
                        for auto-cancellation. At present, all paid (“Premium”) accounts are offered with a 30-day trial
                        period.</p>
                    <p>j) If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and
                        your billing
                        cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new rate
                        starts from the
                        next billing cycle.</p>
                    <p>k) We make a promise to our customers to support our Services until the end of the Internet. That
                        means when it
                        comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy
                        Services. Sometimes it
                        becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services
                        because we think it
                        could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time
                        to modify or
                        discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.</p>
                    <p>l) Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt
                        existing
                        customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing
                        customers. If we do so,
                        we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may
                        also post a
                        notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.</p>
                    <p>m) All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where
                        required, we will
                        collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
                        authorities. See our Taxes
                        policy for more details. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or
                        duties.</p>

                    <p>a) Features and Bugs - We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the
                        experiences of
                        customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that
                        pleases
                        everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or
                        expectations.</p>
                    <p>b) We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our
                        Services
                        inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones,
                        especially any
                        related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee
                        completely
                        error-free Services.</p>

                        maintenance, or updating the Application at any time without prior notice. We will try to limit
